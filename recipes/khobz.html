        <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
        <p>The round Moroccan bread served at most meals is called khobz, but you might also hear it referred to by Berber names of kesra in Tamazight or agroum in Tashelhit.

            Crusty with a coarse interior, it’s perfect for the traditional Moroccan method of eating most dishes by hand using pieces of bread instead of a fork to scoop up Moroccan salads, tagines, other entrees, sides and more.
            
            Wedges of bread may also be split open and stuffed with grilled meats or sandwich fillers of any kind.
            
            Khobz is sometimes described as a flatbread, but the round, flattish loaves are usually thicker than a typical flatbread. While the thickness can vary from bakery to bakery and family to family, generally khobz will not be more than 3 cm high, depending on the flour used. Many Moroccans prefer to keep the height to no more than a 1.5 cm thick.</p>
        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups white flour - preferably high gluten or bread flour</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp yeast</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil - olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
            <li> 1 1/4 cups water - warm (not hot)</li>
            <li>oil, semolina or cornmeal - optional (for preparing the pan)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a large baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper OR lightly oiling it OR dusting it with semolina or cornmeal. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine the flour, salt and sugar in a large bowl. Make a well in the center and add the yeast.</li>
            <li>Add some of the water to the yeast in the well and lightly stir with your fingers to dissolve the yeast (see Recipe Notes below). Add the rest of the water and oil to bowl and stir to combine all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough (in the bowl if it's large enough or on a floured work surface) for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. While kneading, work in a little flour or water as needed to ensure the dough is soft and pliable but not sticky.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into two smooth mounds and place well apart on the prepared pan. Cover with a towel and leave to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>After resting, pat the mounds of dough into flat, round loaves about 1/4" thick. Cover again with a towel and leave to rise for about an hour (longer in a cold room), until the dough springs back when pressed lightly.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 435°F (225°C). When the oven is hot, lightly score the top of the bread with sharp knife or poke in several places with a fork. </li>
            <li>Bake the khobz in the preheated oven, rotating the pan if necessary, for about 20 minutes or golden brown. The loaves should sound hollow when tapped.</li>
            <li>Transfer the khobz to a rack or towel-lined basket to cool. </li>
        </ol>
