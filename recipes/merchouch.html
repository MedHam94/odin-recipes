        <h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
        <p>One of the Moroccan dishes which I consider most notable is rfissa, a trid-like feast of chicken, lentils and heavily-seasoned broth over shredded bread. Although rarely as elegantly presented as shown here, a huge platter of rfissa is nonetheless impressive and appetizing, and its phenomenal blend of flavors make it a favorite among Moroccans and others who are fortunate enough to be introduced to it.

            I first sampled and fell in love with rfissa shortly after giving birth to my first daughter, as it’s long been Moroccan tradition to serve rfissa at that time. That is likely due to fenugreek (helba) being a key ingredient, an herb which is well known to be beneficial to nursing mothers. Rfissa is also commonly served as a special occasion meal, when entertaining, or simply as a family dinner that helps redefine comfort food.</p>
